Homepage (Static Website): This is a basic static HTML page that does not include any dynamic data or interactive elements. You can serve this page directly from a CDN without involving a server at runtime.

About Us (Multi Page App): A traditional web app where each page is its own HTML document. Clicking a link triggers a full page reload.

Blog (Single Page App): An app where the entire site lives on a single HTML page. Navigating to different parts of the site does not trigger a page reload, but instead updates the content dynamically using JavaScript.

Meme of the Day (Server-Side Rendering with Hydration): This page is rendered on the server for each request, then "hydrates" into a fully interactive page on the client.

Meme Gallery (Static Site Generation with Hydration): The page is pre-rendered at build time and served statically, then "hydrates" on the client to add interactivity.

Meme Archive (Incremental Static Regeneration): A variant of SSG where outdated pages are regenerated in the background as traffic comes in, allowing for more up-to-date content without the need for a full rebuild.

Meme Creator (Partial Hydration): This page uses server-side rendering for the initial page load, but only certain parts of the page (like a form for creating a new meme) hydrate into interactive elements on the client.

Vote the Meme (Islands Architecture): This page uses server-side rendering, but different parts of the page ("islands") hydrate independently, allowing for faster interaction times.

Latest Memes (Streaming SSR): The server sends the HTML to the browser in chunks as it's being rendered, allowing the browser to start loading parts of the page sooner.

Meme Series (Resumability): This feature could be implemented as a long list of memes that the user can filter and paginate. If the user leaves the page and comes back later, they can pick up where they left off.
